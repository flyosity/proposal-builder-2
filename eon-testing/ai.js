We are analyzing the browsing activities of a hypothetical business owner signing up for an account 
for Square. IMPORTANT: This business owner we are describing has been browsing various pages on the Square website including `;

const PW_OUTPUT_FINISH = `
Your job is to understand what parts of the Square website they have been browsing recently, then based on their browsing history
make some assumptions about what type of business they run which would draw them to visit those specific pages.

As an example, if they have been browsing the product pages related to Square for Retail and Online Store, it's likely they 
own a retail business and are looking to sell online. If they have been browsing pages related to Square for Restaurants and online store 
then they are looking to manage their restaurant or food business with Square and would likely be interested in online ordering.

Let's place this user within a hypothetical Square account creation workflow and the first screen they see is a text field 
where they are asked why they signed up for Square today and what they want to use Square to do. Please generate 5 example descriptions
where each is 1-2 sentences that someone might write into that text field based on the browsing history I previously mentioned. 
Make sure each description sounds like it could be written by a normal person using language that is 
casual, friendly, including lowercase letters and limited punctatuation to emulate their actual behavior. 

If they've been browsing pages related to retail businesses, DO NOT generate a description that relates to a restaurant.
If they've been browsing pages related to food & beverage businesses, DO NOT generate a description that relates to a retail business.
If they've only been browsing food & beverage pages then all examples you generate should describe a hypothetical restaurant.
If they've only been browsing retail pages then all examples you generate should describe a hypothetical retail business.

Examples:
"I own a boutique named Terry's Threads and sell in person at a retail location downtown. I'd like to expand to online sales!"
"I own and operate 2 Mexican food trucks and also do catering orders on the weekends."

These descriptions should not include any references to the Square website, what pages on the Square website they've been looking at, 
or anything related to browsing activity. They should only be describing their business and their business needs they 
came to Square for. 

Format these examples using HTML as an unordered list, with each example as an <LI> within a larger <UL>.`;
